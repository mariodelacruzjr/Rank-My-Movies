# Smart Movie Posters

The Smart Movie Poster project is a Django-based web application that leverages the power of The Movie Database (TMDB) API and OpenAI's DALL路E 2 to provide users with a unique and interactive experience. This platform allows users to discover, generate, and potentially purchase custom movie posters generated by AI while managing their account's tokens and transactions through Stripe.

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version 3.11.5)
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) (version 4.2.5)
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) (or any other database of your choice)
- [TMDB API Key](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) (for movie data)
- [OpenAI DALL路E 2 API Key](https://beta.openai.com/signup/) (for image generation)
- [Stripe API Key](https://stripe.com/docs/keys) (for payment processing)


### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/mariodelacruzjr/Smart-Movie-Posters.git

2. cd Smart-Movie-Posters

3. pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Create a database and configure database settings in settings.py.

5. Configure API Keys

To ensure the proper functioning of the Smart Movie Poster project, you'll need to configure the following API keys securely:

- **TMDB API Key:** Update this key in your project settings to enable access to movie data from The Movie Database (TMDB).

- **OpenAI DALL路E 2 API Key:** Store this API key securely and update it in your project's settings to enable AI-powered image generation capabilities.

- **Stripe API Key:** Store your Stripe API key securely and update it in your project's settings to facilitate secure payment processing for transactions.

Additionally, don't forget to handle your Django secret key for enhanced project security.

   user.save()
   
   3. Create a Token object associated with the user
   token = Token(user=user)
   token.save()
   
   4. Increase the token_count attribute to 300
   token.token_count = 300
   token.save()
   
   5. Exit the Django shell
